Variables can be defined by different Data types.

Primitive Data types:
            - boolean: true or false
            - byte: number between -128 and 127
            - char: 
            - short: number between -32768 and 32767
            - int: number between -2147483648 and 2147483647
            - long: number between -9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807
            - float: 
            - double: 

OVERFLOW:   MIN VALUE - 1 flows over to MAX VALUE
            MAX VALUE + 1 flows over to MIN VALUE

Casting = convert a number from one type to another

String is a datatype which is NOT a primitive type. It's a class.
A string can contain a sequence of characters.
Strings in Java are immutable. That means you can't change a String after it's created. Instead what happens is a new String is created.
